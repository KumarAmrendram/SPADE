                        <h2>Glasgow Climate Change Conference</h2>
                        <p>The Glasgow Summit officially termed as 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference or more
                            commonly as COP 26; was hosted by the UK this year from 31st <span id="points">...</span>
                            <span id="moreText">October. <br> The annual conference is held to analyze the progress in
                                tackling
                                Climate Change and try to establish goals to reduce Green House Gas emissions. At COP
                                26, leaders from 190 nations along with experts, researchers, and citizens took part to
                                discuss future plans of action on climate change with the primary aim to finalize rules
                                for the implementation of the Paris Agreement 2016.
                                <span id="para"> <br> COP 26 was announced soon after the assessment report released by
                                    the
                                    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Earth’s climate and raises
                                    serious concerns
                                    regarding the future of humanity.</span><br>

                                COP 26 has tried to address the concerns regarding impeding Climate threats and
                                introduced declarations to tackle them. It is the first time since the Paris Agreement
                                in 2015 that countries are required to upgrade or resubmit their pledges known as
                                <br>
                                Nationally Determined Contributions on tackling emissions of carbon dioxide. The Glasgow
                                agreement has emphasized that stronger action in the current decade was most critical to
                                achieving the 1.5-degree target.
                                <br>
                                Financing such lofty climate goals requires a massive amount of resources. The developed
                                countries are historically obligated to finance Green Projects in developing nations.
                                The developed countries had promised to mobilize at least $100 billion every year from
                                2020 but the deadline has now passed away and the first world has affirmed that they
                                will arrange finance by 2023.
                                <br>
                                <b>Parallel Initiatives:</b>
                                <br>
                                Various countries announced parallel goals that are not part of the official COP
                                discussion. Glasgow Summit certainly has accelerated the efforts of various countries.

                        <h2>RBI Scheme Launch- steps towards inclusiveness</h2>
                        <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated two Reserve Bank of India (RBI) customer-centric
                            initiatives on Friday, named The Retail Direct Scheme and the Reserve Bank Integrated
                            Ombudsman Scheme.<span id="points">...</span><span id="moreText"> <br>
                                The Prime Minister said these programs may broaden the scope of investment in the
                                country and make access to capital markets easier and more secure for investors,
                                promoting financial inclusion. He emphasized the citizen-centric nature of these
                                schemes, saying that the strength and proactiveness of a democracy’s grievance redressal
                                system is the biggest touchstone on any democracy and that the Integrated Ombudsman
                                Scheme will go a long way in that way.
<br>
                                The retail direct scheme will allow small investors to receive guaranteed returns by
                                investing in securities and also assisting the government in raising funds for
                                nation-building. The PMO stated that “investors will be able to simply open and maintain
                                their government securities account with the RBI online at no cost.”
<br>                             The governor of the Reserve Bank of India first mentioned the proposal in February 2021.
                                He referred to the scheme as a “major structural transformation.” Investors would need
                                to open and maintain a Retails Direct Gilt Account (RGD) with the RBI to invest in
                                government securities, according to the central bank.
<br>
                                Individuals can open an RDG account by filling out an online form and authenticating and
                                submitting the form using the OTP received on their registered mobile and e-mail ID.
                                Payment for the same can be made from the associated bank account via online banking or
                                UPI.
<br>
                                The Reserve Bank-Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) aims to improve the grievance
                                resolution procedure for resolving customer complaints against firms regulated by the
                                Central bank. According to the PMO, the scheme is based on the concept of “One Nation,
                                One Ombudsman,” with a single platform, one email address, and one address for customers
                                to complain.
<br>
                                The RBI ombudsman scheme’s single national-level integrated digital portal is expected
                                to ensure standardization and a streamlined user-friendly mechanism, adding value to the
                                scheme and bringing customer delight and financial inclusion.
<br>
                                He stated that non-performing assets have been identified with transparency in the last
                                seven years, emphasizing that the current government is focused on resolution and
                                recovery. He claims that recapitalization of public sector banks, bringing cooperative
                                banks under RBI’s jurisdiction, and other changes have increased public confidence in
                                the banking system.
